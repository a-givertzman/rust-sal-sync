//! '/AppName/SubAppName/Device/Point.Name'
//! ```
//! 
//! ##### Point.type
//! 
//! The type of the containing information stored in the Point.value field. Fallowing types are supported:
//! 
//! - Bool - true / false
//! - Int - i64 - The 64-bit signed integer type.
//! - Real - f32 - A 32-bit floating point type (specifically, the "binary32" type defined in IEEE 754-2008).
//! - Double - f64 - A 64-bit floating point type (specifically, the "binary64" type defined in IEEE 754-2008).
//! - String - string of the variable length
//! 
//! ##### Point.value
//! 
//! Contains the information of the type corresponding with the Point.type field
//! 
//! ##### Point.status
//! 
//! The status of the containing information:
//! 
//! - Ok = 0 - Information was successfully updated from the source device;
//! - Obsolete = 2 - For example system was jast started and information stored from the prevouse session;
//! - TimeInvalid = 3 - The time of the server / Device is not synchronized with precision time source;
//! - Invalid = 10 - Information was read from the device but currently connection with that device is lost;
//! 
//! ##### Point.cot
//! 
//! Cause and direction of the transmission:
//! 
//! - Inf - Information - common information basically comming from the Device / Server to the Client
//! - Act - Activation - the command comming from the Client to the Device / Server
